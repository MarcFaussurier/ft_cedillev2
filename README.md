Cédille is a preprocessor, that use C as a preprocessing language. 
This preprocessor can detect and apply any pattern replacement.
Any existing programming language can be implemented using Cédille.



## Demo


[spec.ç](https://github.com/MarcFaussurier/ft_cedillev2/blob/master/spec.%C3%A7)

[outputs with cédille](https://github.com/MarcFaussurier/ft_cedillev2/blob/master/result_a.txt)

[outputs without cédille](https://github.com/MarcFaussurier/ft_cedillev2/blob/master/result_b.txt)


Compile & run the spec file by ignoring macro
```
make nocedille
```

Compile & run the spec file with macro
```
make
```

## Macro engine steps 

```
[x]	1 - The file is read character by character to find out macros
[x]	2 - The file is read character by character to replace out macro by their match (using 1. declarative order)	
[x]	3 - Repeat 1, 2 and stop if nothing change
[ ]	4 - Macro are deleted from the generated result
```

## Todos

```
[ ] - internally detect brace level for macro rule parsing 
[ ] - force 'macro rule' without keywords betweem 'macro' and 'rule'
[ ] - implement a basic C parser in ç to get parenthesis level etc easily within macros
[ ] - apply macros one-by-one and recompile intermediate compiler at each time so that macro defintion may use others macro defintion
```
